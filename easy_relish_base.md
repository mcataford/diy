# Easy basic relish

- Mince some __red onion__ or __shallot__;
- Mince __a pickle or two__ (these can be storebought or homemade, depending on the taste you want);
- Make a 1:1 mix of both of the above in a mason jar and fill with pickle brine;
- Let rest, the longer is rests, the tastier it gets.

The jar should keep in the fridge for up to a month.

_Note:_ This is a great way to use brine leftover from your pickle jars. You can keep the brine in the fridge for months after the pickles have been consumed and use it here.
