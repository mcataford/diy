# Homemade Ginger Beer

Ginger beer is a delish fermented beverage that will take care of your soft drink cravings. To make it, you need __ginger syrup__, __yeast_ and __time__.

## Ginger Syrup

In a saucepan, mix

- 1 cup of white sugar
- 1/2 cup of water
- ~2 tbsp of grated ginger (peel before grating)

Heat over low-medium heat until the sugar is entirely dissolved, then __let rest an hour__.

## Preparing the fermentation

Get yourself a large jar with an airlock (or be ready to burp your jars regularly during fermentation).

In your fermentation vessel, mix in __7-10 cups of water__, the __syrup__ you prepared, __2-3 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice__ and __1/8 tsp of active dry yeast__.

Close up and let sit for __at least three days__. Make sure to store the jar in a dark, dry place.

You can sample your ginger beer every now and then after three days of fermentation, or when you are satisfied, bottle it and store it in the fridge (lasts at least one or two weeks, but I've kept some jars up to a month).
