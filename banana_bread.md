# Banana bread

Got some overripe bananas? Don't let them go to waste!

This recipe is standmixer-friendly, but you can also do it all by hand.

- Mash a 2-3 medium-sized bananas until it's more or less homogeneous. (With a standmixer, just use the beater attachment on the lowest setting for a minute or two)
- Add in 3/4 cup of brown sugar.
- (Optional, but tasty) Add in 2-3 tbsps of maple syrup.
- Add in a splash of vanilla extract (higher quality vanilla extract makes a huge difference in outcome)
- (Optional) Add in the zest of half-a-lemon.
- Make sure all of the above is well-mixed. If using a standmixer, use the beater attachment on the lowest setting for a minute or two)
- Mix about a teaspoon of baking soda with water and add this to the mix
- Use the next-to-lowest setting on the mixer for a minute, or a vigorous round of spoon-beating.
- Add in an egg, repeat the beating above until you can see bubbles in the mix.
- Add 1.5 cups of whole wheat flour and mix it all together until you get a proper dough.

You can pour the dough in a bread pan and bake at 360F~ for about an hour.
